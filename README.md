# IFCS1summative1_task3

Test if a year is a leap year or not 

TDD to create a series of tests guiding me in the creation of this calc

Writing code until I pass all tests

Then I will add additional functionality to allow the user to input a year and test if prime

Finally I will commit to my repo and setup CI


year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 then this is a leap year

or year % 400 == 0 then this is a leap year

Else is not a leap year
